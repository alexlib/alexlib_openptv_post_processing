UNTESTED post-processing scripts
===============================

A banch of UNTESTED post-processing scripts of the OpenPTV output using Matlab and Python. Never use it if you are not
sure in what you're doing or you don't test your results. The code results can easily lead to a wrong physical insight :)

See a quick demo:
